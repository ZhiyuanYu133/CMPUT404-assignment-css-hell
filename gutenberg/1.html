        His tender heir might bear his memory:
        But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
        Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,
        Making a famine where abundance lies,
        Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
        Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,
        And only herald to the gaudy spring,
        Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
        And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:
        Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
        To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.

        COUNTESS.
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

BERTRAM.
And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

LAFEW.
You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such abundance.

COUNTESS.
What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?

LAFEW.
He hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
